# Student Grades Predection
Predict a student's performance in high school, using Linear Regression and training multiple models in python

## Measuring attributes
I used the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)  
33 variable attributes are available to choose from

  * First Grade (G1) in Mathematics
  * Second Grade (G2) in Mathematics 
  * Failures
  * Abscenses
